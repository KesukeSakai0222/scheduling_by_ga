# Scheduling by GA
GA is one of machine learning methods, Genetic Algorithm.
When you fill task's name, person-hour, dead line and importance, this program automatically make schedule.

I penalized schedule for 4 points of view.
- pasting deadline penalty
- remaining task penalty
- excessing task penalty
- same task with last task penalty
